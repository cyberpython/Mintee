{"name":"Mintee","google":"","body":"# Mintee\r\n\r\nMintee (minimal tee) is a simple program to execute a command and write its output to a file and the standard output.\r\nIt kinda works like the Unix tee program, with the exception that only one file can be used to write the output.\r\n\r\n![Mintee concept of operation](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/599926/images/mintee.svg)\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\nThe FPC compiler (2.6+) is necessary to compile the source code - it can be downloaded from [http://www.freepascal.org/download.var](http://www.freepascal.org/download.var).\r\n\r\nTo compile mintee, open a command-line window and change the directory to the one where mintee.lpr is located.\r\nThen give:\r\n\r\n    fpc mintee.lpr\r\n    \r\nThis should produce the mintee executable.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    mintee [OPTIONS] [FILE]\r\n    Copy standard input to FILE, and also to standard output.\r\n    \r\n        -a, --append              append instead of overwriting files\r\n        -c <cmd>, --command=<cmd> execute command <cmd> and read from its output instead of stdin\r\n        --no-stdout               do not write to stdout\r\n    \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDistributed under the terms of the MIT license.\r\nCopyright Â© 2012 Georgios Migdos.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A simple program to execute a command and write its output to a file and the standard output.","note":"Don't delete this file!
